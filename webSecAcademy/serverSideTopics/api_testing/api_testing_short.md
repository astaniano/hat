### You should find out information about the following:
- The input data the API processes, both compulsory and optional parameters
- The types of requests the API accepts, including supported HTTP methods and media formats
- Rate limits and authentication mechanisms

### Look for endpoints that may refer to API documentation, for example:
- /api
- /swagger/index.html
- /openapi.json

### Try changing HTTP method, media type, params (check which are required), check error messages
- check js files, they may contain calls to endpoints that are not listed in the documentation

### Mass assignment vulnerabilities

## Server-side parameter pollution
