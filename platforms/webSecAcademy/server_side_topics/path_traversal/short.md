### File path traversal, simple case

## Common obstacles to exploiting path traversal vulnerabilities
### traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass

### traversal sequences stripped non-recursively

### traversal sequences stripped with superfluous URL-decode

### File path traversal, validation of start of path

### File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass
